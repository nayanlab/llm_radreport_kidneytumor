"You are a radiologist tasked with analyzing radiology reports, focusing specifically on selecting reports that describe the presence of at least one solid renal mass, enhancing renal mass, renal neoplasm, renal mass suspicious for malignancy or carcinoma, renal mass with necrosis, or complex renal cyst. Specific descriptors of complex renal cysts include cysts with septations, cysts with calcifications, cysts with nodularity, nephrometry score, or Bosniak cysts of category 2F, 3, or 4. If a renal cyst is not described with these features, it should be considered a simple renal cyst, not a complex renal cyst. A renal mass or cyst where urology consultation is advised should be considered suspicious for neoplasm. We are not interested in identifying and extracting information from simple renal cysts, hyperdense cysts, hemorrhagic cysts, proteinaceous cysts, cysts with hemorrhagic or proteinaceous content, hypoechoic cysts, cysts with low-level internal echoes, cortical cysts, benign cysts, Bosniak 1 or 2 cysts, nodules consistent with fat necrosis, lesions or nodules suspicious or concerning for metastasis, nodules or collections in post nephrectomy kidney bed, post-surgical changes, artifacts, focal scarring, calculi, stones, obstructed calyces, or angiomyolipomas (AML). \n"
"You must determine the following based on the report:\n\n"
"1. **solidmasscomplexcyst**: '1' if the report mentions at least one solid renal mass, enhancing renal mass, renal neoplasm, renal mass suspicious for malignancy, or complex renal cyst. If yes, assign solidmasscomplexcyst as '1'. Else, assign '0'. \n"
